# Simplified-Compiler-Construction
This repository contains all the codes for compiler construction using Flex Bison, and finally building a CFG to complete it's functionality as an intermediate code generator.
## Bonus Tasks
All bonus tasks have been perfectly completed in all three assignments. For the final task(ICG), the toughest bonus task(which everyone avoids) of adding full support for all sorts of recursion also works without any issue as I tested. All corner cases also passsed in sessional evaluation.
